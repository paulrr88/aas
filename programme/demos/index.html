				<h2 class="centre"><strong>2017</strong></h2><br /><br /><br />

				<p class="centreclear"><strong>2017 continues with another fantastic demo</strong></p>

				<br />

				<p class="centreclear">February brought Leisure Painter contributor Adie Parker to Ferring and what a super demonstration<br /> of her talent she gave. The brief was to paint an interior scene with artificial light...<br />and it started out like this:</p>

				<br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_aparker_01.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">Adie came with a prepared canvas and a palette holding her pre-mixed oil colours.<br />
					She stressed the benefits of looking carefully before painting anything, to seek out the variations<br />
					 in colour and tone throughout a scene and mixing your range of colours and hues<br />
					 before putting a mark on the canvas. She also talked of the value in creating a vibrant "sketch" -<br />
					 she used a chalk outline to mark the main outline and then dropped in a pinkish colour<br />
					 to fix this and provide the initial shape. Some of this would be covered later<br />
					 but some would "shine through" lending life to the finished painting.</p>

				<p class="centreclear">Soon, the painting took shape with careful and thoughtful placement of those pre-mixed tones.</p>

				<br /><br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_aparker_02.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">Adie gave full detail of the colour range she used, never locked into a single manufacturer<br />
					 but choosing those colours that appealed most to her and which she considered most vibrant.<br />
					  Michael Harding Permanent sap green and Mussini Royal blue light got a special mention! <br />
						Taking time to answer all questions from the audience and talking us through every step <br />
						of her process made this an entertaining as well as informative afternoon.<br /><br />
						Time ran out before the painting was completely finished but that was put right a few days later ...</p>

				<br /><br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_aparker_03.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">The final image captures the opulence of the room and the posts on the right hand side sparkle<br />
					like jewels. A bit like Adie's talent!</p>

				<p class="centreclear"><strong>What a fantastic start to 2017!</strong></p>

				<br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_dwhite_01.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">New Forest artist, Dave White, has set the bar high for all our future 2017 demonstrations<br />
					with an excellent session on "Sea and sky" in acrylics ... featuring dogs, clouds<br />
					in the shape of countries and a new approach to perspective applauded by the Royal Academy.<br />
					Can't be bad for a cloudy January afternoon!</p>

				<br /><br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_dwhite_02.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">Next to his canvas he provided examples of his excellent finished work,<br />
					explaining that much of his "bread and butter" came from dog portraits...<br />
					so, alongside his demo we were entertained to stories of the loving owners at Crufts<br />
					and to an explanation of the traits of Setters! Soon all attention turned to his approach to acrylics<br />
					as he helped us appreciate how this medium can be better controlled,<br />
					not least to produce a graduated wash of which any water-colourist would have been proud.</p>

				<br /><br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_dwhite_03.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">Dave involved his audience throughout and with a warning on painting clouds in repetitive shapes<br />
					created an interesting sky using the loose outlines of countries as a starting point.<br />
					Perhaps you can identify Africa, Australia and even Northern Ireland in the images shown.<br />
					This was before he moved down to the beach with its multitude of colours,<br />all taking the viewer's eye towards a preselected vanishing point<br />
					and creating a real sense of depth in the painting.</p>

				<img src="../../img/pr_dwhite_04.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">No wonder that by the end of the session, Dave had hunkered down to sign his latest best-selling<br />
					book for members who wanted to make sure they would have a means of recalling his words<br />
					of wisdom in the years ahead. While on his knees, he really should have been knighted<br />for such a super demonstration, enjoyed by every one!</p>

				<h2 class="centre"><strong>2016</strong></h2><br /><br /><br />

				<p class="centreclear">Kate Osborne helps us paint loose in watercolour...</p>

				<br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_kosborne_01.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">For our final demo of 2016, a large crowd enjoyed an excellent demonstration by<br />
					local Sussex artist, Kate Osborne, showing us how she approached animal painting<br />
					in a "fast and loose" style - and using a relatively compact palette.<br />
					Allowing her colours to merge and blend naturally, and dropping them onto the paper <br />
					with everything from an expensive sable to a Â£1 lady's make-up brush,<br />
					those sheep magically appeared.</p>

				<br /><br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_kosborne_02.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">As Kate had used an overhead projector so everyone could see<br />
					exactly what she was painting, the break was an ideal time to see the actual painting up-close <br />
					and to ask all those questions that had not been asked before.</p>

				<br /><br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_kosborne_03.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
				<img src="../../img/pr_kosborne_04.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">Given it was coming close to Christmas, Kate entertained us with a quick undrawn sketch of a robin -<br />
					complete with holly and berries - and, to finish, a crow using Indian ink. <br />
					Each was accompanied with full notes on the colours and makes that Kate preferred.</p>

				<p class="centreclear">A great session to finish our year and we will be looking forward to welcoming Kate back<br />
					 for a workshop in future.</p>

				<img src="../../img/pr_scarroll_02.jpg" width="400" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">Local artist, Steve Carroll, provided an informative and engaging presentation on the evolution of<br/>
					Cubism, thoroughly enjoyed by all attending. Starting well before Picasso and Braque<br />
					and bringing the story even more up-to-date, Steve entertained us...<br />
					not least with his explanation of how an elephant might look from above to "western" eyes<br />
					as contrasted with the indigenous people of the time. Yes, that's what you're looking at above.</p>

				<img src="../../img/pr_scarroll_04.jpg" width="400" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">To finish the above session, Steve gave us the opportunity to create our first Cubist masterpieces.<br />
					OK, maybe not ... but a hugely enjoyable time was had by all.</p><br />
