                <p class="centreclear"><strong>Rick Holmes kicks off our new year</strong></p>
        
                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
        
                    <p class="centreclear">We were pleased to welcome pastel artist, Rick Holmes, on what was his first ever visit to Ferring. As a member of the Wapping Group, it was no surprise that he chose as his subject a Thames bridge ... how he went about it was more surprising. Working on pre-primed mountboard, he proceeded to apply dark acrylic inks with a roller! Next he used a credit-sized card to apply small marks of Chinese black ink to plot the key elements of his subject. Those watching were relieved when he said "Believe me, pastel will come"!</p>

                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">

    				<p class="centreclear">Rick prefers Unison soft pastels supported by Conte (square edge) and pastel pencils where more detail is required. He tends to blend only the sky areas and applies individual pastel marks across the rest of the painting. One reason for the ink/acrylic background is that this creates the "darks" against which the pastel tones can be best judged. Like so many pastel users, he had a bag load of broken pieces. However, as he chooses colours for the individual painting he keeps them on a separate tray. This helps to keep to a relatively limited palette and create a more harmonious design. Soon the image began to emerge...</p>

                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
    
                    <p class="centreclear">Rick had no magical formula for painting ... neither light to dark nor vica versa. Rather, it was whatever seemed most appropriate. His aim was to create a "loose realistic" style, already evident in the emerging painting. When working from a photograph, Rick suggested the use of black and white images to help with tonal values while allowing the artist to be selective over colour choices. However, Rick is a regular outdoor painter and waxed lyrically on the benefits to be gained from regular "plein air" painting. His one caveat was to restrict time to about 2 hours as the sun's movement over a longer period could lead to problems.</p>

                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
    
                    <p class="centreclear">With over 30 people attending, there were many questions throughout the demo all answered clearly by Rick aided by his gentle humorous style. To supplement today's painting, he had brought a wealth of previous work for all to enjoy and had time to share several fully-framed works ... wryly remarking that these were the onesnot selected for the latest Pastel Society Mall exhibition - though he does have one in there!</p>

                    <p class="centreclear">Our thanks to Rick for a super start to our 2018 demos. Don't forget you can see Rick in action again on Monday evening, 26th February at the Mall (painting alongside Roger Dellar and Geoff Hunt) as part of the Wapping Group exhibition at the Mall Gallery.</p>
