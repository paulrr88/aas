                <p class="centreclear"><strong>Zen and the art of painting in the now!</strong></p>

				<br />

				<p class="centreclear">Hurricane Brian did not deter a large attendance for our latest demo and we were well rewarded<br />
                    thanks to the inspiring and informative local artist, Christine Forbes.</p>
    
                <br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_cforbes_001.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">Christine laid out her approach to painting as colourfully as she laid out her palette.<br />
                    First and foremost, drawing is everything ... draw until you're bored .. then draw some more.<br />
                    What matters to Christine  is line, form and space; and, perhaps linking to her exploration<br />
                    of Zen Buddhism, she urged us to "paint in the now". By this, she explained, we should<br />
                    worry less about how the painting might turn out ... or whether it would sell ...<br />
                    but simply enjoy the actual process of painting, allowing our minds to relax<br />
                    and our intuition to take control!
                    </p>
    
                <br />
    
                <img src="../../img/pr_cforbes_002.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">Working on the flat and with watercolours, Christine used some of her existing artwork<br />
                    to demonstrate her "anti-painting" approach. Not for her expensive sable brushes<br />
                    but synthetic ones with "boing-ability", dead biros, pencils (used on their own<br />
                    or tipped with paint), twigs and so on. She recommended 160gsm cartridge paper<br />
                    for warming-up before using more expensive Bockingford watercolour paper.</p>
    
                <br />
    
                <img src="../../img/pr_cforbes_003.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">Drawing on John Berger's "Ways of seeing", Christine encouraged us to think about our senses<br />
                    as we painted. For her, touch was as important to sight ... how the pencil or brush<br />
                    felt in her hand translated into whatever appeared on the paper. Through these marks<br />
                    she made real her personal perception of reality and urged us to ensure our paintings<br />
                    reflected what we felt as well as saw in the world.</p>
    
                <br />
    
                <img src="../../img/pr_cforbes_004.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">Christine finished a stirring and engaging afternoon by hammering home her mantra<br />
                    that "drawing is everything"  adding that constant repetition would "magnify and nurture"<br />
                    our future artwork. I am sure we all came away believing that Hurricane Brian had less power<br />
                    and energy than our visiting artist!</p>
                
                <br />

                <p class="centreclear"><strong>Bath comes to Sussex via Essex!</strong></p>

				<br />

				<p class="centreclear">Our latest demonstrator was Essex-based Paul Alcock and he chose as his subject a street in Bath.<br />
                    Paul often paints "plein aire" and showed us several examples of his fine work, some completed<br />
                    over several sessions (making sure the time of day/weather conditions were similar)<br />
                    and others in less than two hours.</p>
    
                <br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_palcock_01.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">A good crowd turned out, keen to see Paul in action and hear about the water-mixable oils<br />
                    he was using. Paul felt there was little difference between these and more "traditional" oils<br />
                    and that the techniques were similar, with the use of specially produced thinners and mediums<br />
                    to abide by the "fat-over'lean" principle. He ran through his palette and his special use<br />
                    for a piece of discarded venetian blind - keeping his little piles of paint slightly separate<br />
                    from the rest of the palette!</p>
    
                <br />
    
                <img src="../../img/pr_palcock_02.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">Paul used a pastel pencil to mark only the main features of his subject but created<br />
                    the overall image freely using paint directly - something he does more regularly now<br />
                    as he believes this helps to create a more lively and vibrant end-product. He starts in one position -<br />
                    in this case the little arch on the left - and builds out from there. Having created the arch,<br />
                    he uses this to establish the comparative size, position and so on of the other buildings.<br />
                    If something is a bit "out" - as happened with his first positioning of the roof-line - Paul showed<br />
                    how easy it was with these paints to correct issues "on the hoof"!
</p>
    
                <br />
    
                <img src="../../img/pr_palcock_03.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">In less than an hour we could see the painting take shape and in the second half<br />
                    Paul brought it all to life, changing some of the tones in the mid-ground and adding the two silhouetted<br />
                    figures to add interest. The large tree was darkened to draw it forwards and help to frame the archway<br />
                    while Paul used yet another piece of blind to help create some of the guttering of the main building.<br />
                    Creative indeed!</p>
    
                <br />
    
                <img src="../../img/pr_palcock_04.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">Just before ending, Paul had time to share some tips on painting outdoors<br />
                    and carrying oil paintings safely - and show us some of his typical street gear.<br />
                    All added to a successful afternoon's demonstration.</p>

                <p class="centreclear"><strong>Superlative portrait painting by Andrew James</strong></p>

				<br />

				<p class="centreclear">On this Queen's birthday, we were royally entertained by Kent-based artist, Andrew James,<br />
                    creating a vibrant and emotion-packed portrait of model, Jack. He explained<br />
                    how portraiture starts with forming that human connection with the sitter before determining<br />
                    the "mechanics" - the positioning of artist and model, and the sources of light which create form<br />
                    and help determine the depth of shadow. Then the fun began... not with a careful outline<br />
                    of Jack's face but a few minutes worth of what seemed like frenetic scribbling...</p>
    
                <br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_ajames_01.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">As the random doodle became a human shape, Andrew took up his palette and applied<br />
                    large blocks of colour, reflecting only light and shade and the warm and cooler sides of the head.</p>
    
                <br />
    
                <img src="../../img/pr_ajames_02.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">Whereas some artists might prefer their model to remain as still as possible,<br />
                    Andrew freely engaged Jack in conversation, happy to answer questions on his technique and<br />
                    approach. Andrew explained how he had chosen the colours on his palette to reflect the tones<br />
                    he saw in Jack's skin. Today he had chosen Titanium white, lemon yellow (known as bright lake<br />
                    in Michael Harding), yellow ochre, Cadmium red, magenta, pthalo blue, burnt umber and a light green.<br />
                    To a question from the audience, Andrew mentioned that he ofter found viridian green useful<br />
                    in black skins but that he was too vibrant in most Caucasian skin tones.</p>
    
                <br />
    
                <img src="../../img/pr_ajames_03.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">Andrew stressed that - in his approach - it was critical to establish the whole face and allow<br />
                    individual elements to emerge rather than become obsessed with detail in, say, the eyes<br />
                    or the mouth. For this reason, he used a limited number of (hogs hair) brushes, all close in size,<br />
                    and did not resort to smaller brushes in areas like the eyes. He believes that this ensures<br />
                    a consistency in how the paint is applied even when the actual brushstrokes are varied. </p>
    
                <br />
    
                <img src="../../img/pr_ajames_04.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">The last part of the painting was the background, purposely left so Andrew could use it<br />
                    both to help "carve" the image into the ground and also to ensure he matched the facial tones<br />
                    with those behind. It was interesting how at this stage Andrew would apply strokes<br />
                    to the background ... then back to the face ... then the background and so on.<br />
                    Another way of maintaining all-round harmony.</p>
                
                <br />
    
                <img src="../../img/pr_ajames_05.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">Time beat us all in the end and Andrew was forced to end the session long before he thought<br />
                    a polished painting would emerge. While he thought of it as no more than "an instructive sketch",<br />
                    the audience was delighted to have been present for a true masterclass of portraiture.<br />
                    Model Jack was also delighted when he was presented with the final canvas.</p>

                <p class="centreclear"><strong>Masterclass from Liz Seward</strong></p>

				<br />

				<p class="centreclear">A large crowd welcomed back renowned artist (and our President), Liz Seward.</p>

				<img src="../../img/pr_lseward_01.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">Following an impassioned plea for members to take an active role in the society to ensure its <br />
                    prosperity, Liz gave us a clear insight into her current work, describing it as<br />
                    "watercolour but not as you've known it"!</p>
    
                <img src="../../img/pr_lseward_03.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">Her set-up for the day was a typical table layout but, having spent many years on working<br />
                    in a realistic style, she found herself drawn more by pattern and shape,<br />
                    seeing things more in two dimensions and as silhouettes.</p>
    
                <img src="../../img/pr_lseward_02.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">So, it was not long before her approach on paper became clear. But this was not going to be<br />
                    just a painting demonstration. Liz took time to share her love of particular papers,<br />
                    brushes and colours, explaining in detail to the audience the differences - shortfalls and benefits -<br />
                    of using varying items. Amongst her favourite colours were Hansa light by Daniel Smith<br />
                    and Indian Yellow and coeruleum blue by Golden - applied with "big square brushes<br />
                    to avoid fiddling", recommending Da Vinci. The masterclass continued with<br />
                    an exposition on the different types of watercolour paper available, reinforcing that cotton based<br />
                    products (such as Arches or Langton Prestige) with their longer strands could take more washes<br />
                    than cellulose-based products - though, of course, would cost more.</p>
    
                <p class="centreclear">Moving from paints, Liz said that she had become a greater advocate for watercolour pencils<br />
                    recently given an improved selection on the market. The main issue here, she stressed,<br />
                    was for artists to be aware of just how light-fast the pencils would be. Caran d/Ache Luminance<br />
                    were amongst her favourites and were exhibition quality being totally lightfast. Sennelier<br />
                    could be a good alternative. Adding to this mixed-media demo, Liz used Neo-colour wax crayons<br />
                    which - to the surprise of some - were water soluble to reinforce highlights and<br />
                    Windsor and Newton colour markers to emphasise some outlines<br />
                    (a technique she uses mostly with collage).</p>
    
                <img src="../../img/pr_lseward_04.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">The session came to an end far too quickly for we had been entertained not only to a fine painting<br />
                    but an in-depth masterclass by a first-class artist.</p>

                <p class="centreclear"><strong>Karin Moorhouse and the sleeping beauty!</strong></p>

				<br />

				<p class="centreclear">Erstwhile Artist-in-Residence at Arundel Castle, Karin Moorhouse was our recent demonstrator, <br />
					creating in oils a lovely painting of her grand-daughter, Ruby ... whom Karin has painted regularly<br />
					to recall the child's early years. Karin began by establishing a "box" to build the main shape,<br />
					stressing that this was not a paint-by-numbers but a dynamic, creative process.</p>

				<img src="../../img/pr_kmoorhouse_01.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear"><br />
					Karin gave us good advice on using triangulation as a means of checking the position of the key<br />
					features and encouraging us to keep to "big shapes" rather than be drawn in by any details<br />
					at this stage. With a few deft strokes a likeness already began to appear:</p>

				<img src="../../img/pr_kmoorhouse_02.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear"><br />
					Moving on from establishing a basic shape, Karin focused on what would become<br />
					the darkest areas - with the mantra of "darks thin, lights fat" - rejecting any use of white<br />
					at this stage as this would hinder creating the deepest darks: </p>

				<img src="../../img/pr_kmoorhouse_03.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear"><br />Only at this stage, Karin began to introduce colour, adding red to adjust the temperature, <br />
					 ensuring it reflected the age and skin tone of the subject. The key issue here<br />
					 is to avoid over-use of primary colours to avoid the whole thing becoming too high-key,<br />
					 not to say brassy. Karin's usual palette included titanium white, bleached white<br />
					 (sometimes called buff white), yellow ochre, terra rosa, burnt sienna, cadmium red,<br />
					 ultramarine blue and raw umber. With colour now on the canvas, a fan brush was used<br />
					 to soften edges, remove some brush marks and to help refine the planes of the face:</p>

				<img src="../../img/pr_kmoorhouse_04.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear"><br />
					With so much useful discussion created as the demo unfolded, this was as far as Karin<br />
					was able to complete on the day but sent us this next version following another studio session.<br />
					Still not fully completed - another image is promised soon - but with the colours now settling<br />
					and the shift from one tone to the next becoming more subtle, we see the real quality<br />
					of Karin's art. Almost as beautiful as Ruby herself!</p>

				<img src="../../img/pr_kmoorhouse_05.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear"><br />
					And here's Karin's final image of the sleeping beauty. Lovely stuff:</p>

				<p class="centreclear"><strong>2017 continues with another fantastic demo</strong></p>

				<br />

				<p class="centreclear">February brought Leisure Painter contributor Adie Parker to Ferring and what a super demonstration<br /> of her talent she gave. The brief was to paint an interior scene with artificial light...<br />and it started out like this:</p>

				<br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_aparker_01.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">Adie came with a prepared canvas and a palette holding her pre-mixed oil colours.<br />
					She stressed the benefits of looking carefully before painting anything, to seek out the variations<br />
					 in colour and tone throughout a scene and mixing your range of colours and hues<br />
					 before putting a mark on the canvas. She also talked of the value in creating a vibrant "sketch" -<br />
					 she used a chalk outline to mark the main outline and then dropped in a pinkish colour<br />
					 to fix this and provide the initial shape. Some of this would be covered later<br />
					 but some would "shine through" lending life to the finished painting.</p>

				<p class="centreclear">Soon, the painting took shape with careful and thoughtful placement of those pre-mixed tones.</p>

				<br /><br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_aparker_02.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">Adie gave full detail of the colour range she used, never locked into a single manufacturer<br />
					 but choosing those colours that appealed most to her and which she considered most vibrant.<br />
					  Michael Harding Permanent sap green and Mussini Royal blue light got a special mention! <br />
						Taking time to answer all questions from the audience and talking us through every step <br />
						of her process made this an entertaining as well as informative afternoon.<br /><br />
						Time ran out before the painting was completely finished but that was put right a few days later ...</p>

				<br /><br />

				<p class="centreclear">The final image captures the opulence of the room and the posts on the right hand side sparkle<br />
					like jewels. A bit like Adie's talent!</p>

				<p class="centreclear"><strong>What a fantastic start to 2017!</strong></p>

				<br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_dwhite_01.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">New Forest artist, Dave White, has set the bar high for all our future 2017 demonstrations<br />
					with an excellent session on "Sea and sky" in acrylics ... featuring dogs, clouds<br />
					in the shape of countries and a new approach to perspective applauded by the Royal Academy.<br />
					Can't be bad for a cloudy January afternoon!</p>

				<br /><br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_dwhite_02.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">Next to his canvas he provided examples of his excellent finished work,<br />
					explaining that much of his "bread and butter" came from dog portraits...<br />
					so, alongside his demo we were entertained to stories of the loving owners at Crufts<br />
					and to an explanation of the traits of Setters! Soon all attention turned to his approach to acrylics<br />
					as he helped us appreciate how this medium can be better controlled,<br />
					not least to produce a graduated wash of which any water-colourist would have been proud.</p>

				<br /><br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_dwhite_03.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">Dave involved his audience throughout and with a warning on painting clouds in repetitive shapes<br />
					created an interesting sky using the loose outlines of countries as a starting point.<br />
					Perhaps you can identify Africa, Australia and even Northern Ireland in the images shown.<br />
					This was before he moved down to the beach with its multitude of colours,<br />all taking the viewer's eye towards a preselected vanishing point<br />
					and creating a real sense of depth in the painting.</p>

				<img src="../../img/pr_dwhite_04.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">No wonder that by the end of the session, Dave had hunkered down to sign his latest best-selling<br />
					book for members who wanted to make sure they would have a means of recalling his words<br />
					of wisdom in the years ahead. While on his knees, he really should have been knighted<br />for such a super demonstration, enjoyed by every one!</p>

				<p class="centreclear">Kate Osborne helps us paint loose in watercolour...</p>

				<br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_kosborne_01.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">For our final demo of 2016, a large crowd enjoyed an excellent demonstration by<br />
					local Sussex artist, Kate Osborne, showing us how she approached animal painting<br />
					in a "fast and loose" style - and using a relatively compact palette.<br />
					Allowing her colours to merge and blend naturally, and dropping them onto the paper <br />
					with everything from an expensive sable to a £1 lady's make-up brush,<br />
					those sheep magically appeared.</p>

				<br /><br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_kosborne_02.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">As Kate had used an overhead projector so everyone could see<br />
					exactly what she was painting, the break was an ideal time to see the actual painting up-close <br />
					and to ask all those questions that had not been asked before.</p>

				<br /><br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_kosborne_03.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
				<img src="../../img/pr_kosborne_04.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">Given it was coming close to Christmas, Kate entertained us with a quick undrawn sketch of a robin -<br />
					complete with holly and berries - and, to finish, a crow using Indian ink. <br />
					Each was accompanied with full notes on the colours and makes that Kate preferred.</p>

				<p class="centreclear">A great session to finish our year and we will be looking forward to welcoming Kate back<br />
					 for a workshop in future.</p>

				<img src="../../img/pr_scarroll_02.jpg" width="400" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">Local artist, Steve Carroll, provided an informative and engaging presentation on the evolution of<br/>
					Cubism, thoroughly enjoyed by all attending. Starting well before Picasso and Braque<br />
					and bringing the story even more up-to-date, Steve entertained us...<br />
					not least with his explanation of how an elephant might look from above to "western" eyes<br />
					as contrasted with the indigenous people of the time. Yes, that's what you're looking at above.</p>

				<p class="centreclear">To finish the above session, Steve gave us the opportunity to create our first Cubist masterpieces.<br />
					OK, maybe not ... but a hugely enjoyable time was had by all.</p><br />
