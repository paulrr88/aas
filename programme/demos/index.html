				<p class="centreclear">For our final demo of 2016, a large crowd enjoyed an excellent demonstration by<br />
					local Sussex artist, Kate Osborne, showing us how she approached animal painting<br />
					in a "fast and loose" style - and using a relatively compact palette.<br />
					Allowing her colours to merge and blend naturally, and dropping them onto the paper <br />
					with everything from an expensive sable to a Â£1 lady's make-up brush,<br />
					those sheep magically appeared.</p>

				<br /><br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_kosborne_02.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">As Kate had used an overhead projector so everyone could see<br />
					exactly what she was painting, the break was an ideal time to see the actual painting up-close <br />
					and to ask all those questions that had not been asked before.</p>

				<br /><br />

				<img src="../../img/pr_kosborne_03.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
				<img src="../../img/pr_kosborne_04.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">Given it was coming close to Christmas, Kate entertained us with a quick undrawn sketch of a robin -<br />
					complete with holly and berries - and, to finish, a crow using Indian ink. <br />
					Each was accompanied with full notes on the colours and makes that Kate preferred.</p>

				<p class="centreclear">A great session to finish our year and we will be looking forward to welcoming Kate back<br />
					 for a workshop in future.</p>

				<p class="centreclear">Local artist, Steve Carroll, provided an informative and engaging presentation on the evolution of<br/>
					Cubism, thoroughly enjoyed by all attending. Starting well before Picasso and Braque<br />
					and bringing the story even more up-to-date, Steve entertained us...<br />
					not least with his explanation of how an elephant might look from above to "western" eyes<br />
					as contrasted with the indigenous people of the time. Yes, that's what you're looking at above.</p>

				<p class="centreclear">To finish the above session, Steve gave us the opportunity to create our first Cubist masterpieces.<br />
					OK, maybe not ... but a hugely enjoyable time was had by all.</p><br />
