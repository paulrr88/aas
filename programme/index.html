                <p class="centreclear"><strong>Clothed Figures in Pastel by Debbie Hinks</strong></p>
        
                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
				    <p class="centreclear">Despite a temporary change of venue, to St Andrews Church Centre, the demonstration was well attended, boosted by 10 guests. Debbie is a professional artist and illustrator, and has taught at Northbrook Colllege. She now runs life drawing classes and sessions in the Brighton area.</p>
                        
                    <p class="centreclear">Debbie gave us a summary of her career to date, sharing examples of her illustration work. It is amazing how large the original work is, before being reduced to book cover size.</p>
                    
                    <p class="centreclear">After a brief description of her materials, Debbie warmed up for the main event, by demonstrating a portrait in charcoal. She explained that in addition to the usual willow charcoal, she used condensed charcoal (more intense/darker) and even white charcoal. She worked on grey Fabriano Tiziano paper, and used an interesting technique with cotton wool to apply charcoal dust for subtle toning on the face.</p>
                </div>

                <img src="../img/pr_dhinks_001.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
                
                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p class="centreclear">Debbie then started to work on the details with charcoal pencils. She sharpens all her pencils with a scalpel to achieve the point she wants. A plastic rubber is used to lift off, and can also be shaped for fine work. By the break she had completed a very striking image.</p>
                </div>
                
                <br />
                
                <img src="../img/pr_dhinks_002.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
                
                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p class="centreclear">After the break Debbie started to work on a figure drawing, using a piece of off-white Fabriano Tiziano paper. Initially she used a sanguine Conte pastel pencil to compose the figure on the page. Once happy with the composition she rapidly sketched out the main elements, using relative angles and paying partcular attention to the negative spaces. She then took care with the face, especially the eyes. Again the cotton wool was used to apply tone to the face and the picture as a whole. She switched from the peach /burnt sienna colours to a dark blue to add in the darks and the image started to appear three-dimensional.</p>
                </div>
        
                <br />
        
                <img src="../img/pr_dhinks_003.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
                
                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p class="centreclear">Highlights were added and Debbie used a cotton bud to apply tone with more precision. In a suprisingly short time a finished image appeared before our eyes.</p>
                </div>
                
                <br />
        
                <img src="../img/pr_dhinks_004.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
                
                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p class="centreclear">Debbie engaged with the audience throughout the presentation, and everyone seemed to enjoy the session. Many said that they had learnt new skills. A thoroughly enjoyable afternooon for our last demonstration before the summer break. See you again in September.</p>
