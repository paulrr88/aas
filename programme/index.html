				<p class="centreclear"><strong>Superlative portrait painting by Andrew James</strong></p>

				<br />

				<p class="centreclear">On this Queen's birthday, we were royally entertained by Kent-based artist, Andrew James,<br />
                    creating a vibrant and emotion-packed portrait of model, Jack. He explained<br />
                    how portraiture starts with forming that human connection with the sitter before determining<br />
                    the "mechanics" - the positioning of artist and model, and the sources of light which create form<br />
                    and help determine the depth of shadow. Then the fun began... not with a careful outline<br />
                    of Jack's face but a few minutes worth of what seemed like frenetic scribbling...</p>
    
                <br />

				<img src="../img/pr_ajames_01.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">As the random doodle became a human shape, Andrew took up his palette and applied<br />
                    large blocks of colour, reflecting only light and shade and the warm and cooler sides of the head.</p>
    
                <br />
    
                <img src="../img/pr_ajames_02.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
    
                <p class="centreclear">Whereas some artists might prefer their model to remain as still as possible,<br />
                    Andrew freely engaged Jack in conversation, happy to answer questions on his technique and<br />
                    approach. Andrew explained how he had chosen the colours on his palette to reflect the tones<br />
                    he saw in Jack's skin. Today he had chosen Titanium white, lemon yellow (known as bright lake<br />
                    in Michael Harding), yellow ochre, Cadmium red, magenta, pthalo blue, burnt umber and a light green.<br />
                    To a question from the audience, Andrew mentioned that he ofter found viridian green useful<br />
                    in black skins but that he was too vibrant in most Caucasian skin tones.</p>

                <p class="centreclear">Andrew stressed that - in his approach - it was critical to establish the whole face and allow<br />
                    individual elements to emerge rather than become obsessed with detail in, say, the eyes<br />
                    or the mouth. For this reason, he used a limited number of (hogs hair) brushes, all close in size,<br />
                    and did not resort to smaller brushes in areas like the eyes. He believes that this ensures<br />
                    a consistency in how the paint is applied even when the actual brushstrokes are varied. </p>

                <p class="centreclear">The last part of the painting was the background, purposely left so Andrew could use it<br />
                    both to help "carve" the image into the ground and also to ensure he matched the facial tones<br />
                    with those behind. It was interesting how at this stage Andrew would apply strokes<br />
                    to the background ... then back to the face ... then the background and so on.<br />
                    Another way of maintaining all-round harmony.</p>

                <p class="centreclear">Time beat us all in the end and Andrew was forced to end the session long before he thought<br />
                    a polished painting would emerge. While he thought of it as no more than "an instructive sketch",<br />
                    the audience was delighted to have been present for a true masterclass of portraiture.<br />
                    Model Jack was also delighted when he was presented with the final canvas.</p>
