                    Our final demo of 2017 started with an interesting insight into the use of lighting,<br />
                    vital with portraiture. Roger explained - and demonstrated - how variations<br />
                    in cold and warm bulb lighting could impact on the "tone" of the final painting.<br />
                    From lighting, he moved to the relative position between model and artist...<br />
                    noting the differences that could flow from having the eye contact above, below and level.<br /><br />
                
                Soon it was time to get some paint flowing.</p>

                <p class="centreclear">The first broad strokes appeared almost unthinking as Roger stressed how he began<br />
                    with a general "mass" which would continuously become more refined. In fact,<br />
                    his first "refinements" were pulling out some of the applied oil paint with a rag<br />
                    to help establish the position of facial features. He was not keen on finite measuring<br />
                    but preferred to see the angles between points - eye to nose to mouth to chin - comparing this<br />
                    to how a sailor navigates. Only five minutes in and already we could see the general shape<br />
                    of model Jack's head appear from those apparently random scribbles</p>
    
                <br />

                <p class="centreclear">Roger worked in a combination of traditional and water-mixable paints<br />
                    plus a white alkyd (to help drying) all held together with white spirit. He used<br />
                    a limited palette of primary colours emphasising that success was related to tone<br />
                    rather than specific colour choices. For brushes, he did recommend Rosemary brushes, gently<br />
                    dropping a hint that he would soon have his own name on some of these products.<br />
                    His physical palette was easy cleanable glass with fold-over sides which would help<br />
                    keep the paint safe and moist during transport.</p>

                <p class="centreclear">It is all too easy for an artist to become so absorbed in the painting that he forgets<br />
                    to explain to the audience what is actually going on... this cannot be said for Roger Dellar.<br />
                    Throughout the demo, Roger gave a running commentary on his thinking - why he moved<br />
                    from broad strokes to smaller; how he built-up shapes with short, straight lines; where he felt<br />
                    edges should be pronounced or "lost"... and so on. He even had time for a number of anecdotes<br />
                    which brought to life the relationship that must develop between artist and model. </p>

                <p class="centreclear">In under two hours, the final painting emerged - a powerful depiction of Jack<br />
                    with that back-to-front baseball cap. Roger still wasn't finished and explained how -<br />
                    given a little more time - he would further enhance the portrait. The hearty round<br />
                    of applause suggested that the audience thought no more was required! The old adage<br />
                    that you save the best for last seems to have proved true with our final 2017 demo -<br />
                    and leaves us looking forward to Roger's eventual return.</p>
