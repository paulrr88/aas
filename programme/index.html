				<br />

				<p class="centreclear"><strong>Karin Moorhouse and the sleeping beauty!</strong></p>

				<br />

				<p class="centreclear">Erstwhile Artist-in-Residence at Arundel Castle, Karin Moorhouse was our recent demonstrator, <br />
					creating in oils a lovely painting of her grand-daughter, Ruby ... whom Karin has painted regularly<br />
					to recall the child's early years. Karin began by establishing a "box" to build the main shape,<br />
					stressing that this was not a paint-by-numbers but a dynamic, creative process.</p>

				<img src="../img/pr_kmoorhouse_01.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear"><br />
					Karin gave us good advice on using triangulation as a means of checking the position of the key<br />
					features and encouraging us to keep to "big shapes" rather than be drawn in by any details<br />
					at this stage. With a few deft strokes a likeness already began to appear:</p>

				<img src="../img/pr_kmoorhouse_02.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear"><br />
					Moving on from establishing a basic shape, Karin focused on what would become<br />
					the darkest areas - with the mantra of "darks thin, lights fat" - rejecting any use of white<br />
					at this stage as this would hinder creating the deepest darks: </p>

				<img src="../img/pr_kmoorhouse_03.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear"><br />Only at this stage, Karin began to introduce colour, adding red to adjust the temperature, <br />
					 ensuring it reflected the age and skin tone of the subject. The key issue here<br />
					 is to avoid over-use of primary colours to avoid the whole thing becoming too high-key,<br />
					 not to say brassy. Karin's usual palette included titanium white, bleached white<br />
					 (sometimes called buff white), yellow ochre, terra rosa, burnt sienna, cadmium red,<br />
					 ultramarine blue and raw umber. With colour now on the canvas, a fan brush was used<br />
					 to soften edges, remove some brush marks and to help refine the planes of the face:</p>

				<img src="../img/pr_kmoorhouse_04.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear"><br />
					With so much useful discussion created as the demo unfolded, this was as far as Karin<br />
					was able to complete on the day but sent us this next version following another studio session.<br />
					Still not fully completed - another image is promised soon - but with the colours now settling<br />
					and the shift from one tone to the next becoming more subtle, we see the real quality<br />
					of Karin's art. Almost as beautiful as Ruby herself!</p>

				<img src="../img/pr_kmoorhouse_05.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear"><br />
					And here's Karin's final image of the sleeping beauty. Lovely stuff:</p>
