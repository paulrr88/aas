				<p class="centreclear"><strong>"Painting a fantasy face in watercolour" by Sharon Hurst</strong></p>
        
                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p class="centreclear">Despite the dismal weather the event was well attended. There were only just enough seats for everyone, including 10 guests.</p>
                        
                    <p class="centreclear">Sharon travelled from Hampshire and was clearly full of enthusiasm for both her subject matter and medium. The support she used was Bockingford NOT 140lb paper that had not been stretched, but was firmly secured with good brown adhesive tape. The paints used were mainly Shin Han watercolour tubes.</p>
                    
                    <p class="centreclear">The subject for the day had been drawn out in pencil, and the head had been masked with blue masking fluid. One of her trade mark backgrounds was then rapidly applied with a large brush to a very wet paper. Despite working almost vertically, no runs or drips occurred.</p>
                </div>

                <img src="../img/pr_shurst_001.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
                
                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p class="centreclear">Sharon then demonstrated her basic skin tone mix Burnt Sienna with a touch of Alizarin Crimson and toned down with a touch of Burnt Umber. A great deal of water was then added to create the face skin tone wash. The face and arms of the subject were given a quick wash. We were told for not the last time <em>not to touch it when it’s wet</em>. Shaping was applied to the dried surface with a slightly stronger mix of the same wash. A two brush technique was demonstrated – one for the paint and one for the clean water. Sharon went into detail of the anatomy of the face, and how a portrait painter can apply large shapes to quickly gain a convincing likeness.</p>

                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p class="centreclear">After the break Sharon started to paint in the features. Using a smaller brush and all the time telling the audience what she was doing and why. We were treated to a lesson on anatomy as well as painting.</p>

                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p class="centreclear">By the end of the session Sharon had achieved a very convincing image of an attractive young woman. She explained that many more washes and attention to detail would be needed before completion.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p class="centreclear">The audience were engaged, informed and entertained. Thank you Sharon for an excellent start to our demonstration programme for 2019.</p>
