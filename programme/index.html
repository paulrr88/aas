				<br />

				<p class="centreclear"><strong>2017 continues with another fantastic demo</strong></p>

				<br />

				<p class="centreclear">February brought Leisure Painter contributor Adie Parker to Ferring and what a super demonstration<br /> of her talent she gave. The brief was to paint an interior scene with artificial light...<br />and it started out like this:</p>

				<br />

				<img src="../img/pr_aparker_01.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">Adie came with a prepared canvas and a palette holding her pre-mixed oil colours.<br />
					She stressed the benefits of looking carefully before painting anything, to seek out the variations<br />
					 in colour and tone throughout a scene and mixing your range of colours and hues<br />
					 before putting a mark on the canvas. She also talked of the value in creating a vibrant "sketch" -<br />
					 she used a chalk outline to mark the main outline and then dropped in a pinkish colour<br />
					 to fix this and provide the initial shape. Some of this would be covered later<br />
					 but some would "shine through" lending life to the finished painting.</p>

				<p class="centreclear">Soon, the painting took shape with careful and thoughtful placement of those pre-mixed tones.</p>

				<br /><br />

				<img src="../img/pr_aparker_02.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">Adie gave full detail of the colour range she used, never locked into a single manufacturer<br />
					 but choosing those colours that appealed most to her and which she considered most vibrant.<br />
					  Michael Harding Permanent sap green and Mussini Royal blue light got a special mention! <br />
						Taking time to answer all questions from the audience and talking us through every step <br />
						of her process made this an entertaining as well as informative afternoon.<br /><br />
						Time ran out before the painting was completely finished but that was put right a few days later ...</p>

				<br /><br />

				<img src="../img/pr_aparker_03.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />

				<p class="centreclear">The final image captures the opulence of the room and the posts on the right hand side sparkle<br />
					like jewels. A bit like Adie's talent!</p>
