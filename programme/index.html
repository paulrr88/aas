                <p class="centreclear"><strong>A portrait in oils by Tony Parsons</strong></p>
        
                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
				    <p class="centreclear">The demonstration was very well attended, boosted by 15 guests.</p>
                        
                    <p class="centreclear">Tony is a local artist from Brighton. He paints every day and has previously worked as a caricature artist. He has a long association with the sea, and currently drives the Brighton life boat and lives on a boat.</p>
                    
                    <p class="centreclear">Tony agreed to work from a photograph, taken on the day, of a brave volunteer, Elaine. He stressed that while he had no problem with working from a photograph, it would inevitably produce a different result than working from life.</p>
                    
                    <p class="centreclear">He talked through his limited palette and stressed the importance of learning how each of the colours behave, especially when mixing. He believes that if you introduce a new colour, it takes at least 6 months of use before you fully understand it. Today he was painting on a canvas board and using ZestIt as the solvent. The board had been primed with gesso, coloured a light grey with paynes grey, and containing Polyfilla dust.</p>
                    
                    <p class="centreclear">We were warned that there would be no pre-drawing. Chaos was the starting point and hopefully a likeness would appear. Without any predrawing, Tony applied areas of dark tone to the canvas. It was definitiely difficult to spot a likeness a this stage.</p>
                </div>

				<br />
                
                <img src="../img/pr_tparsons_001.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
                
                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p class="centreclear">Tony then started to apply areas of highlight, again using a large brush. He constantly referred to the importance of tonal value. “Tone does the work, and colour gets the credit”. By the break for tea, a likeness was beginnng to emerge. This was likened to a nervous wild animal. “Take great care not to lose it, once it has been captured.”</p>
                </div>
                
                <br />
                
                <img src="../img/pr_tparsons_002.jpg" style="margin-left: 220px;" />
                
                <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p class="centreclear">After the break Tony switched to a smaller, softer brush. The ZestIt had evaporated from the earlier painting and it was possible to paint over it, although you only had a couple of brush strokes before the layers would blend producing mud. He repeatedly walked a long way back from the painting to review the progress, explaining that he did not want to get bogged down in the detail.</p>
                    
                    <p class="centreclear">Managing to combine painting with a constant explanation of what he was doing, Tony worked all over the painting. Never focussing on one area the image began to emerge. Almost the final stage was to apply a dark green background, pushing the face forward. In common with all Tony’s work there was a real sense of light in the work. Elaine certainly seemed pleased - she bought the final picture.</p>
