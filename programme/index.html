Despite this our valiant demonstrator made it through and a small and enthusiastic group of members and guests was treated to a very entertaining and informative afternoon.</p>
                    
                    <p class="centreclear">Lindsey started off with an interactive warm-up session. Everyone had the chance to draw an item in pencil. The items included asparagus, pine cones and foliage. The only constraint was that you could not look at the pencil or paper at any time – only the item being drawn. After a couple of goes at the first item, everyone swapped to a different item. Lindsey explained that it was also a useful exercise to provide inspiration for new paintings and showed us some examples of work she had developed following this exercise.</p>
                    
                    <p class="centreclear"><p class="centreclear">Lindsey explained the advantages of Brusho, aka Earth Inks, as well as the pitfalls and dangers. Information sheets were handed out to back up her practical explanation of how to mix and store the medium. She the went on to demonstrate the initial stages of a painting including drawing in ink or brusho using wooden kebab sticks and wooden stirers from Costa Coffee (other brands are available).</p>
                    
                    <p class="centreclear">During the break members were able to talk with Lindsey and inspect the materials in use, as well as the work completed.</p>

                    <p class="centreclear">After the break Lindsey continued to demonstrate various techniques including wet in wet, and developing a painting from an initial abstract pattern.</p>

                 <div style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p class="centreclear">She then showed various examples of her completed work and talked through the many techniques used to develop them. Finally she asked for questions and judging by the number and range raised it was clear that the audience had remained thoroughly engaged throughout.</p>
                     
                    <p class="centreclear">Lindsey has promised to visit our exhibition in August. It would be great if there are some works in Brusho included!</p>
