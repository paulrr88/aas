                    <h1>2017 Exhibition coming closer</h1>

                    <p>Our next annual exhibition will be taking place from Monday 31st July until Saturday 6th August. Admission is free and is open each day from 10am to 5.30pm ... with late night opening on Thursday until 8pm. All original paintings to view and for sale, with prices more than competitive with High Street galleries.</p>

                    <p>As usual, we will have a raffle for an excellent painting by a well-known local artist with donations in support of St Barnabas Hospice.</p>

                    <p>So, tell all your friends and let's make 2017 our mist successful exhibition ever.</p>

                    <h2>Best of show judge</h2>

                    <p>We are delighted to welcome local professional artist, Catherine Barnes, to "bring encouragement and recognition" (as she puts it) by acting as judge to our artistic endeavours! Catherine has exhibited throughout the major capitals of Europe and has exhibitions of her own in Chichester (right now!) and at the Bankside Gallery, London in November 21st to 26th. Get to them if you can. For more details, see <a href="http://www.catherinebarnes.com/">www.catherinebarnes.com</a> or <a href="CatherineBarnesExhibition.pdf">click here for a PDF</a>!</p><br /><br />

                    <p>Every three months or so, club members exhibit some of their work in our local doctor's surgery. So, if you have to wait for your appointment, there is always more to capture your attention than NHS information on the potential diseases out there! Feedback from patients and staff is good and - of course - all the paintings are for sale.</p>
