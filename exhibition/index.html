                    <h1>The 2019 Exhibition supporting Wadars</h1>
                    
                    <br />

                    <p>Our recent exhibition proved a real success and thoroughly enjoyed by our many visitors. We were lucky that the weather was good for our preview, allowing guests to enjoy their drinks  "en plein aire" while they discussed the fine art on display.  The introduction of 3D work proved a valuable addition, creating added interest and contributing to our sales figures which were up on previous years.</p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps the main thing is that feedback from our visitors confirmed that the standard of work presented continued to be of a high standard - to the credit of all our members.</p>
                    
                    <p>We had two prizes on offer for "best liked artwork". Visitors         voted for "Happy" by Yvonne Venning and Members voted for         "Turning tide" by Pauline Parkinson. While our President, Liz         Seward, visited the club recently, we took the opportunity for         her to present tokens of our appreciation to the two worthy         winners. Our congratulations to Yvonne and Pauline.</p>

                    <p class="centreclear">Our chosen charity this year was WADARs, the local animal rescue charity. Our thanks goes to local artist, Brien Howard, who provided two excellent watercolours for our raffle. This  raised Â£170 for the charity so we also thank all who bought a ticket! The winners were Alison from Rustington and Pat from Ferring - both were delighted as you can see from the photos.</p>

                    <p>Every three months or so, club members exhibit some of their work in our local doctor's surgery. So, if you have to wait for your appointment, there is always more to capture your attention than NHS information on the potential diseases out there! Feedback from patients and staff is good and - of course - all the paintings are for sale.</p>
