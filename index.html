				<p><strong>Demonstrations by professional artists</strong> are held <a href="programme/">nearly every month</a> on Saturday afternoon in the Ferring Village Hall, and visitors are warmly invited to attend.</p>

				<p>Our <strong>annual Art Exhibition</strong> is held at the <a href="exhibition/">end of July/beginning of August</a> for one week at Ferring Village Hall, with members' framed and unframed art for sale. A party is held on the first evening!</p>
