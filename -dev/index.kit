                <h2 class="centre" style="background: yellow; color:red;">In response to the Government's advice to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, the Art Club's activities have been suspended since 17th March.</h2>
                
                <h2 class="centre bold">This does not mean that such a thriving and active club just stops everything. As things improve, we are looking to continue with our summer programme, albeit with smaller numbers of artists taking part, while making sure all "social distancing" rules are observed.</h2>
                
                <img src="img/frontpage4.jpg" alt="Picture by Christopher Ball" class="frontpage" />

                <h2 class="centre bold">We have one Demonstration, using Zoom technology, planned for 18th July. Renowned professional artist, Chris Forsey will paint a landscape in acrylics in his inimitable style. Other Zoom demonstrations may well follow, depending on circumstances.</h2>

                <h2 class="centre bold">Accepting that we will be unable to host our usual indoor annual exhibition in July, we are looking at the possibility of creating a one-day outdoor exhibition. Each artist would caretake their own work so it would be an opportunity for the public to talk directly about the paintings on view.</h2>

                <h2 class="centre bold">We are also liaising with Ferring Radio (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/FerringRadio/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://ferringradio.wordpress.com/">website</a>) to support their "Summer of Local Art" programme.</h2>

                <h2 class="centre bold">Finally, our winter programme is being developed, maybe with indoor and outdoor events incorporated.</h2>
